# Laravel Code Challenge

This challenge is to assess a small range of your Laravel knowledge. We would like you to spend no more than 2 hours on this task. It's not a problem if you don't finish everything in the task. The goal is to get a clear view of how you think and work.

## The Challenge
The challenge will contain a few core features most applications have. That includes connecting to an API, basic MVC, exposing an API, and finally tests.

The API we want you to connect to is https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/programming/ten/

The application should have the following features

### Must haves
- A web page that shows 3 random jokes
- A button to refresh the jokes on the page
- An API route should be available to fetch the 3 jokes for the page
- Create tests for the application
- Provide a README on anything we need to set up and test the application

### Nice to haves
- Authentication for the page should be done with a password 
- The API route is secured with a token

### Notes
HTML/CSS/JS styling is not required at all. It doesn't matter how this application looks, only how it functions.
